### Day 0:

The theme **Running out of Space** was just anounced.

With that in mind, and given that I'd really like to improve upon my world building / lighting skills, I'll leave my comfort zone and focus on a game that's not too heavy on the programming side of things. Personally, I mostly enjoy story-driven games with a strong narrative. So that's my goal for this jam.
